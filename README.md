# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game

> My first project ever! A simple two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game created in Python, a fun and classic game of strategy. It's a great starting point for learning basic programming concepts like loops, functions, and conditional logic. 🥳

## 📚 About

This project is a straightforward implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game, designed to be played in the console. Players take turns entering the number corresponding to the position where they want to place their mark. The game checks for a winning condition or a tie after each move, declaring the winner or a "cat's game" if no one wins.

This was my very first personal project, a great way to put what I've learned into practice and understand how to build a complete, runnable application from scratch.

## 📌 Features

- **2-Player Mode**: Play against a friend on the same computer.
- **Customizable Symbols**: Change the default 'X' and 'O' symbols to anything you like.
- **Input Validation**: The game handles invalid inputs, making sure players choose available spots and valid numbers.
- **Replay Option**: Start a new game after one ends without re-running the script.
- **Winner Detection**: Automatically detects and announces the winner.
